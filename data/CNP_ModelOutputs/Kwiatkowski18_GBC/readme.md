"POC/N/P" are small POM, "GOC/N/P" are large POM measured in mmol/m3.

Annual mean netcdf output files of the PISCES-quota ocean biogeochemistry model under historical and rcp8.5 forcing. Files have been regridded to a regular 1° x 1° grid and are described and analyzed in the following manuscript:

Kwiatkowski, L., Aumont, O., Bopp, L., Ciais, P. The impact of variable phytoplankton stoichiometry on projections of primary production, food quality and carbon uptake in the global ocean, Global Biogeochemical Cycles, (2018).

Use the values from 2010s (l = 160:169) to 2090s (l = 240:249).
